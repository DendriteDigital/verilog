# verilog

This project creates a video pixel array and keyboard controller.
One hundred twenty eight 8 by 8 pixel characters are stored in a ROM.
Two 12-bit colors are selected per character on the display. 
The data is provided by the address register and the ROM. 
Soon the data will come from RAM including the characters, 
freeing up the user to define his own games and utilites.
